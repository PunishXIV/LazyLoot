# FFXIV-LazyLoot 

Plugin for Final Fantasy XIV (Originally by 53m1k0l0n)

Various commands to need, greed, or pass on all loot. Chat and Toast output and delay for rolling. Configurable to optionally always pass certain items, like if an item level doesnt met your minimum requirement or if the item (Minion, Cards, Musics, etc) is already unlocked (item has a checkmark).

# Commands

* `/lazy` : Open Lazy Loot config.
* `/lazy need` : Roll need for everything. If impossible roll greed or pass if need or greed isn't successful.
* `/lazy greed` : Roll greed on all items or pass if greed isn't successful.
* `/lazy pass` : Pass on things you haven't rolled for yet.
* `/fulf` : Toggle FULF (Fancy Ultimate Lazy Feature), which will roll items automatically for you, based on your settings.
* `/fulf [on|off]` : Enable or Disable FULF.
* `/fulf need | greed | pass` : Change FULF mode.
